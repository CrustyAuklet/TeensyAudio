Based on the PRJC audio sheild and prop sheild, this is a combination 
of features I needed for a project in the teensy form factor. If all 
you need is microSD playback to a speaker in a small size this board will
do the job! The Audio shield was too large and I didn't use 90% of the features, 
and the prop sheild was great but I needed microSD so I can play normal WAV files. 
This was the result.
